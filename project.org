Websocket stream

Output: mix symbols or separate per symbol?  
  - File handle for every symbol, could run out of space on local machine
    if we start asking for multiple symbols

  - Mixed makes download client easier
  - Separate makes downstream analysis more efficient
  - Batch job to separate symbols?
    - could start once per day then increase

Schedule job for 9:15am? cloudwatch rules/ event bridge
   - task has to know when to end
     - GetClock api from tradier

Env variables
 --Tradier auth key : Secrets manager?
  
Modules
 1. websocket streamer
    - input: list of symbols
    - output: return channel w/ stream of data
 
 2. gzip writer
    - input: stream of data
    - output: channel of file names

 3. aws uploader
    - input: channel of file names
    - output: logs/metrics


Things that can fail:
API Calls -- 
Tradier - setting up the connection
Getting the key (key manager)


* TODO Start/Close for market hours
* TODO Setup Infrastructure w/ CDK
** TODO Code Repo
** TODO Fargate + Cloudwatch timer/starter
** TODO CloudWatch monitor for failures
* TODO Pull tradier key from secrets manager
* DONE Pull options for underlying symbols
* DONE Retry Websocket failures
* DONE Gracefully close channels on SIGTERM
* DONE Move to AmazonLinux (dockerhub limits)

* TODO (Low Priority) Find a better distro. AmazonLinux is very large
* TODO extend Websocket timeout
